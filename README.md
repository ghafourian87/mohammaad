## ðŸ”§ Website Deployment on Ubuntu VPS

I successfully deployed a personal website on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Ubuntu 24.04.  
Key tasks included:

- Installing and configuring Apache2 web server  
- Connecting a custom domain via DNS A-record and configuring VirtualHost  
- Enabling HTTPS with Letâ€™s Encrypt using Certbot  
- Uploading site files using FileZilla (SFTP)  
- Troubleshooting 404 and SSL issues by reviewing Apache logs  
- Verifying full accessibility via both domain and IP

**Tech Stack:** Apache2, Ubuntu, FileZilla, Letâ€™s Encrypt, DNS, SSH
